# Scope
The goal of Research Lab 3 (RL3) is to provide you a perspective of distributed frameworks in 
other application domains. We will explore MPI-based application for parallel processing in the 
High-Performance Computing (HPC) domain. While this domain traditionally supported 
computational work in the science domains, it is/can be extended to other data intensive 
applications. 
 
The lab can be viewed in either a science or data approach. Scientific applications are numerous 
and well documented on the Internet. For instance, diffusion, fluid dynamics, and linear solvers. 
For applications that may be more familiar with engineering or distributed computing, working 
with many data files or large data sets easily maps to problems where Hadoop-like engines 
perform the same work on many sets of data (parallelization). 
 
Choosing which direction your team explores is up to your team. Be aware that like the 
previous labs, we are looking for in-depth investigation and learning, and while there are many 
online source repositories of completed MPI-based diffusion or other work. The spirit and 
scoring of the lab is based on your work.  

# Technologies
RL3 is inherently C/C++ focused on MPI, GPU, or similar scaling. Use of a front-end to drive the 
C/C++ is common (e.g., mpi4py) is an option but not the entirety of the body of work for the 
lab. 
 
A data set (but not limited to) has been uploaded (subset of books) to Canvas, the complete 
data set is 2+ Gb. There are other sets available (e.g., cal fire, world data bank, or possibilities of 
social media mining).
